You will receive the FULL TEXT of a Malay history/archaeology/heritage document. Extract ONLY the title, abstract, source (Sumber), and main content.

IMPORTANT: The extracted BODY_BLOCK should contain AT LEAST 80-90% of the original word count. If your extraction removes too much, you're being too aggressive. The metadata (top/bottom headers, references) usually accounts for only 10-20% of the document. Keep ALL main content paragraphs and sections.

NOTE: If the text contains <Content>...</Content> wrapper tags, you may encounter them, but you should extract ALL content including the wrapper content if present.

KEEP:
- TITLE (TAJUK): the article's title
- ABSTRACT (ABSTRAK): if present, keep verbatim
- SOURCE (SUMBER): the publication/journal source value ONLY (e.g., if you see "Sumber : Jurnal Antarabangsa Alam dan Tamadun Melayu (JATMA)", return only "Jurnal Antarabangsa Alam dan Tamadun Melayu (JATMA)")
- MAIN CONTENT: ALL section headings (Pendahuluan, Kaedah, Hasil, Perbincangan, Kesimpulan, etc.) and their paragraphs
- ALL content from first section after abstract until end of document (including Kesimpulan)
- ALL narrative paragraphs, descriptions, and substantive content

DROP:
- Only the header metadata block at the top (before ABSTRACT) - things like "ID Fail", "Penulis", "Tarikh", "Bidang", "Format", etc.
- Only the reference list at the bottom (if clearly marked "Rujukan:" or "Bibliografi:")
- Page numbers, headers, footers (if present)
