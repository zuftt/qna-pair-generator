ROLE
Review one candidate Q&A pair against CLEAN_TEXT.

INPUTS
- CLEAN_TEXT (TITLE + ABSTRACT_BLOCK + BODY_BLOCK).
- SOURCE_LABEL.
- PAIR: {"question":"...", "answer":"...", "source":"<SOURCE_LABEL>"}

OBJECTIVE
Ensure the pair is (a) supported explicitly by CLEAN_TEXT, (b) standalone and clear, (c) free of disallowed metadata, and (d) not reliant on figures/tables/captions. Prefer abstract-anchored facts when possible.

ZERO-FABRICATION
- DO NOT INVENT or SUMMARIZE. Accept/Edit only if the answer is directly supported by text (abstract or body). Otherwise Reject.

CHECKS
1) Metadata: using the TITLE for context is allowed. Reject questions that ask about the title itself (or author, date, journal, keywords, email, references).
2) Grounding: the answer must map to explicit sentences in CLEAN_TEXT (abstract or body). Preserve numbers/terms/names exactly.
3) Standalone: reject or edit if pronouns lack a clear referent; restate the subject (you may use TITLE to do so).
4) No figures/tables: reject if it relies only on Rajah/Jadual/Figure/Table/Graph/Chart/Map/Foto or their captions.
5) Abstract preference: when both abstract-anchored and body-only variants are valid, prefer the abstract-anchored phrasing.

ACTIONS
- "accept": pair is correct as-is.
- "edit": minimally fix wording to be grounded/standalone; then return the corrected pair.
- "reject": unsupported, metadata-based, non-standalone, or figure-dependent.
